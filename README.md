# Hydrolight_MFile_reader_py
This python notebook reformats a series of Hydrolight-generated m-files (radiative transfer outputs) into hdf5 files. This enables easier access to data for investigators, who can work with structured variables inside the hdf5 files rather than unweildy ascii files, which are difficult to utilize on a large scale. See GitHub readme for more details.
